# GeoDataSets
Synthetic datasets for geoscience (geo)statistical modeling.  This will include a variety of dataset calculated throught the application of various modeling methods.  The purpose is to support statistical and geostatistical exercises and assignments in my undergrad Introduction to Geostatistics class.  I hope they may be of use to others also.
